# Feedback exercise

Download or generate a text file of employee feedback. We in Equinor use real feedback for a real employee (one of us). Give the text file to the participants.

Get the group to read, or at least skim, the feedback. If there is time, it could even be interesting to get them to perform the summarization task themselves before using an LLM.

Challenge the group to perform some typical line manager tasks, for example here are some ideas:

- Summarize the feedback for the person. (Try using leading questions, eg "Summarize this feedback for my star employee" or try revealing then changing the name of the employee.)
- Ask the LLM to recommend a development plan for the next 12 months.
- Ask for strengths and weaknesses.
- Ask for 3 quotes that praise and 3 that constructively criticize the employee.
- Ask the LLM to review the quality of the feedback.
