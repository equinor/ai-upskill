# Helpdesk exercise

> [!NOTE]
> Under development

The file _CSV COMING SOON_ contains helpdesk tickets. The goal is to use ChatGPT to get insights from the tickets. These insights have been validated by a data analyst, so participants will know how well they are doing.

Questions to get at:

- Which tasks is the LLM good at in a zero shot sense? 
- Can the LLM write code that runs and answers the questions in a better way?
- How could LLM insights augment the UI in the hekp system?
