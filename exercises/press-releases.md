# Press releases

This exercise was designed for a group of energy marketing & supply analysts.

We downloaded about three hundred and seventy-five 2022 posts from a petroleum company's Telegram feed, all in the Russian language, and stored them in a spreadsheet with datetime stamps. 

We set up the task by describing a couple of key events in 2022, and the effect of those events on natural gas prices in Europe. 

We asked the group to go through some of the posts and indentify whether the post indicated anything about gas supply potentially increasing (eg a new field coming online, or a new pipeline opening), or decreasing (eg depleted reserves or pipeline maintenance).

We then asked the group to try asking ChatGPT to analyse the same posts in the same way. We could then compare the indicators from human experts with those of the LLM.

Other possible tasks:

- Compare with actual supply (more likely, price) movement from historical data.
- Ask the LLM for price movement prediction directly.
- Ask for reasoning and check this with expert reasoning.
- Use press releases from multiple sources, or from an independent source.
- Ask the LLM to write a post on a given topic, or to predict the next three posts. How well does it match the style?
