# Sessions

We use a few different approaches:


## Synchronous upskill events

- Presentations (live or remote), eg [45-mins-high-tech.md](./45-mins-high-tech.md)
- Workshops, eg [2-hour-demo.md](./2-hour-demo.md)
- Webinars (online only, repeatable, final one recorded)
- Townhalls, eg see [townhall.md](./townhall.md)
- Seminar or conference (group share)
- Course
- Safety moment, eg see [safety-moment.md](./safety-moment.md)


## Asynchronous upskill tools

- Website 'hub' or portal
- Learning path or online learning workflow
- Published media, eg blog or Intranet article
- Social media, eg Viva Engage
- Wiki content
- Forum


## Elements of events

- Survey, eg Menti
- Whiteboard or iPad drawing
- Presentation
- Slides (minimal) or websites etc
- Demo (live prompt or live code)
- Games, eg Say What You See, Play a Game, etc
- At-table conversation (eg brainstorm, capture w stickies)
- Slides
- Q&A w facilitators
- Discussion in the room (generally not ideal)


## Design considerations

- Sync or async, and duration 
- Overhead or prep time
- Depth / technical level
- Purpose of event:
  - Knowledge and understanding
  - Mythbusting
  - Pitfalls
  - Reassurance or real talk about staffing levels
  - Rules and compliance
  - Intuition building
- Learner segment and reach:
  - Whole company
  - Large groups, eg about 40+
  - Smaller groups, under 40 people
  - Leader groups
  - Individuals
