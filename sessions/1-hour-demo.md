# One-hour demo

This is a one-hour information sharing demo of generative AI, in particular chat AI. It is intended to give a high-level look at what is interesting, but also to be realistic about risks.

The intended audience is semi-technical. This demo is not interactive.

## Agenda

Hand something out at the start, eg some stickers, or a cheatsheet (see [the `assets` folder](../assets)).

- **Fire safety** &mdash; observe that there are many things in the room that are designed to protect us from the risk of fire; AI is a potentially dangerous technology and we are still figuring out the safety measures we need. Or see [`safety-moment.md`](./safety-moment.md)
- **Introduce self**
- **Poll** &mdash; ask 3 short, relevant questions of the audience. The goal is to gauge how they feel about AI, their readiness level, and their level of enthusiasm or optimism. Consider hiding the results until most people have voted. Use Mentimeter or Microsoft Forms.
- **What is AI?** &mdash; some big-picture context setting, best done on a whiteboard or in a drawing app (I used an iPad and cast to my laptop). I usually try to disambiguate ML and AI.
- **Generative AI** &mdash; show people an AI chat application. Show a simple task, show sensitivity to the prompt, then a hallucination. Quick challenge (5 mins): audience can try to elicit a hallucination.
- **Main demo** &mdash; I tend to dwell on hallucinations a bit, but you could also build some chat threads towards other topics, like few-shot prompting or RAG.
- **Q&A** &mdash; make sure there is some time for at least 3 or 4 questions, or leave time between segments. There are always questions; try asking "What questions do you have?" rather than "Any questions?".
- **Discussion** &mdash; if you want, you can provoke the group with a question. Use Mentimeter for responses if you want to capture them or have the group hear them all.

I also like to leave the group with a challenge or homework, eg gathering Q&A pairs for evaluation, or designing a prompt for some specific task. And maybe give them some places to go to learn more if they want.
