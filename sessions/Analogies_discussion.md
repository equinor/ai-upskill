# Analogies

What is an LLM like? Einstein? A teenager?

I have heard quite a few analogies:

- Sam Altman famously said that GPT-5 is "PhD-level in anything".
- "You need to treat LLMs like a teenager: give them clear instructions, etc." — an Equinor project
- "It's like having Einstein in your basement" (not creepy at all!) — Henrik Kniberg
- "An LLM is like an intern" – commonly heard
- Bender et al called LLMs "stochastic parrots"
- "Like a librarian who has read every book" — can't remember where I heard this

## What do you think? 

What are LLMs like? Are they like anything? Are they like humans at all? Do these analogies help understanding at all, or do they merely set us up for a set of expectations that likely do not hold? ("A teenager would never do this!")

If LLMs are not like any human, what kind of stories or analogies can we use to help others understand what capabilities LLMs have, and also what their weaknesses are?

## Thoughts

Depending on the audience, it may help to kick-start the conversation with a demo — show an LLM behaving like Einstein (good luck!), then behaving like a stochastic parrot. Show how almost any analogy has its limits.
