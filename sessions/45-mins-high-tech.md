# 45 minutes demo

This is a 45-minutes information-sharing demo of generative AI, in particular chat AI. It is intended to give a high-level look at what is interesting, but also to be realistic about risks.

The intended audience is not technical.

## Agenda

Hand something out at the start, eg some stickers, or some other reminder of the experience.

- **Introduce self**
- - **Safety moment** &mdash; use a chat app to introduce the basics of text-to-text, using a non-technical example. This should lead naturally to a hallucination, to underscore that the prompt changes the output, and that some outputs are wrong.
- **Mentimeter** &mdash; ask 3 short, relevant questions of the audience. The goal is to gauge how they feel about AI, their readiness level, and their level of enthusiasm or optimism. Consider hiding the results until most people have voted.
- **What is AI?** &mdash; some big-picture context setting, best done on a whiteboard or in a drawing app (I used an iPad and cast to my laptop). I usually try to disambiguate ML and AI. If the audience is non-technical, keep it very high level. For example, I highlight three aspects of AI: its goals (per the Dartmouth definition of John McCarthy), rule-based models (aka symbolic AI, eg Deep Blue, Siri), and machine learning (as the current paradigm). This leads naturally to ChatGPT and generative models.
- Do something interactive, eg
  - **Current affairs** &mdash; If there's been something in the news, you could investigate that a bit. For example, did the US tariff programme really come from ChatGPT? Do LLMs really make up references and legal cases? 
  - **The hallucination game** &mdash; get people to elicit a hallucination from a chatbot. Usually some leading questions about something they know well (Equinor, or their home town or favourite sports team) will do it.
  - **Text to image** &mdash; get people to play [Google's Say What You See](games/third-party-games.md). Give a small prize for the highest score.
  - **Image to text** &mdash; We can go the other way too. Share your phone's screen and take a photo of something to ask ChatGPT (or similar) about. For an extra fun task, see the [AI chef game](games/ai-chef.md) 
- **Q&A** &mdash; make sure there is some time for at least 3 or 4 questions, or leave time between segments. There are always questions; try asking "What questions do you have?" rather than "Any questions?".

Sum up to remind people of the safety highlight, the essence of AI, and the image generation.
