# Two-hour demo

This is a two-hour interactive, information sharing demo of generative AI, in particular chat AI. It is intended to give a high-level look at what is interesting, but also to be realistic about risks. It builds on the [one-hour demo](./1-hour-demo.md) by adding interactive elements.

The intended audience is semi-technical.

It's a good idea to have 2 people presenting.

## Agenda

Hand something out at the start, eg some stickers, or a cheatsheet (see [this repo](https://github.com/equinor/ai-upskill-events)).

- **Fire safety** &mdash; observe that there are many things in the room that are designed to protect us from the risk of fire; AI is a potentially dangerous technology and we are still figuring out the safety measures we need. See also [the safety moment description](./safety-moment.md).
- **Introduce self or selves**
- **Mentimeter** &mdash; ask 3 short, relevant questions of the audience. The goal is to gauge how they feel about AI, their readiness level, and their level of enthusiasm or optimism. Consider hiding the results until most people have voted.
- **What is AI?** &mdash; some big-picture context setting, best done on a whiteboard or in a drawing app (I used an iPad and cast to my laptop). I usually try to disambiguate ML and AI.
- **Meet generative AI** &mdash; it's fun to start with a gentle introduction, eg Google's _Say What You See_ (see [third-party-games.md](./third-party-games.md)). It takes about 15 to 20 minutes, get people to call out their best score. Have a prize for the top score.
- **More generative AI** &mdash; show people an AI chat application. Show a simple task, show sensitivity to the prompt, then a hallucination. A group exercise (10 mins): play [the hallucination game](./hallucination-game.md).
- **Main demo** &mdash; I tend to dwell on hallucinations a bit, but you could also build some chat threads towards other topics, like few-shot prompting or RAG. The content depends mainly on how technical the audience is, and what kind of discussion you want to have later.
- **Exercise** &mdash; do a group exercise getting the group to work in pairs on a task. Make it as relevant to the audience as possible. Examples: get a group of managers to try summarizing some made-up employee feedback, or to make a set of development goals. Get a group from HR to explore bias issues, eg by making lists of imaginary people in various occupations. Get them to start with a simple prompt, critique the result, and iteratively improve the prompt. Review the task at the end. Show them a prompt you made earlier.
- **Q&A** &mdash; make sure there is some time for at least 3 or 4 questions, or leave time between segments. There are always questions; try asking "What questions do you have?" rather than "Any questions?".
- **Discussion** &mdash; provoke the group with a question, eg "What opportunities do you see?" or "What's the one thing you wish you could do with AI?". Use Mentimeter for responses if you want to capture them or have the group hear them all.
