# Thrid-party games

Others have created machine learning and artificial intelligence games. Here are a few:

- [**Google's Say What You See**](https://g.co/arts/CcxCfSar2XWWKxMZ7) &mdash; a gentle introduction to prompt engineering. Great for groups that are relatively new to the concept of generative AI or prompt engineering. Challenge the group to work alone or in pairs to get the highest score they can (anything over 90% is a great score, over 95% is very hard to achieve). It's not totally clear how the scoring works so don't fixate on it though. People can just call out their scores. Ask for people to share what they learned at the end. Allow 10 minutes for playing the game and at least 5 minutes for reflection.
- [**Lakera's Gandalf**](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/intro) &mdash; a gentle introduction to jailbreaking and prompt engineering. The object is to extract a secret from the AI; it starts easy and gets very difficult. Great for nerdy groups with high digital literacy, especially those interested in cybersecurity.
