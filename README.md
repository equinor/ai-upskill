# ai-upskill-events

We have been running and thinking about a few different events, workshops, presentations, etc. They are described in this repo.

- [Sessions](./sessions/README.md) describes the different kinds of experiences.
- [Games](./games/README.md) records various fun learning activities we have tried.
- [Exercises](./exercises/README.md) provides more structured learning activities.
- [Assets](./assets) contains some other resources we use in workshops.
