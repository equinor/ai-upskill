# ai-upskill-events

As part of our effort to upskill Equinor in artificial intelligence, our small team has run a few different events, workshops, presentations, etc. They are described in this repo.

- [Sessions](./sessions/README.md) describes the different kinds of experiences.
- [Games](./games/README.md) records various fun learning activities we have tried.
- [Exercises](./exercises/README.md) provides more structured learning activities.
- [Assets](./assets) contains some other resources we use in workshops.

We have been running these events since February 2024, and will continue to develop the program into 2025.

We maintain a few other repos containing learning material related to machine learning and artificial intelligence.

- [`llm-engineering-101`](https://github.com/equinor/llm-engineering-101) for a short workshop aimed at getting developers up to speed.
- [`ml-pitfalls`](https://github.com/equinor/ml-pitfalls) for more on pitfalls in discriminative machine learning, another series of events.
