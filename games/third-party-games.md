# Thrid-party games

Others have created machine learning and artificial intelligence games. Here are a few:

- [**Google's _Say What You See_**](https://g.co/arts/CcxCfSar2XWWKxMZ7) &mdash; a gentle introduction to prompt engineering. See below for a full description.
- [**Sightengine's _AI or Not?_**](https://sightengine.com/ai-or-not) &mdash; a simple game: look at an image and choose **AI** or **Not AI**. If you are correct, you score a point. You can stop at any point, but after every 25 images you get the opportunity to see how your stats compare to others, as well as your accuracy on each class of image (it would be even cooler if you could see your precision and recall!). The game could lead to a discussion on what gives an AI image away, how AI images should be labeled (should the prompt be included?), and what creativity means in the AI age.
- [**Lakera's _Gandalf_**](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/intro) &mdash; a gentle introduction to jailbreaking and prompt engineering. The object is to extract a secret from the AI; it starts easy and gets very difficult. Great for nerdy groups with high digital literacy, especially those interested in cybersecurity.

## Say What You See

- Purpose: introduction to text-to-image generation; introduction to concept of prompting; basic prompt engineering.
- Time required: about 15 minutes.
- Group size: up to about 60, after that it might need a bit more organization, or a couple more people to go around the room and help people get started. People can easily work alone or in pairs.

This game from Google is fun to play. Players are shown a generated image and must write a short prompt that reproduces the image as closely as possible. The app generates a similarity score, expressed as a percentage. Achieving 50% or so is fairly easy; over 90% is quite difficult. Different levels of the game require increasingly close matches to progress. (Note that it's not totally clear how the scoring works so don't fixate on it.)

We introduce learners to the game and help them find it and get into the game (it requires a Google search and a couple of clicks). After that, most people understand what to do quite quickly. People play the game alone or in pairs and we ask them to call out high scores, which we track informally. One could award small prizes to the last few best scores, or even to the highest and lowest scores. Ask for people to share what they learned at the end.
