## AI Chef

We did this demo at a Scandic hotel in Bergen. The hotel enjoyed the collaboration almost as much as we did :)

The audience was a large group of offshore workers, many of whom were engaged in catering functions. We ran two sessions, one with a chocolate cake and one with a smoothie.

- Get a photo of a cake or smoothie from the hotel &mdash; a real photo of something they would normally make.
- Get ChatGPT (or similar) to give you a recipe for the item. You can provoke some creativity by asking for a "special", "creative", "exciting" or "memorable recipe. If that doesn't work, ask for a regional or seasonal twist, or add some other constraints like "I need to feed 80 people" or "Make sure it's nut-free, also I have no butter". You need something that is similar to the hotel's version, but not the same.
- Provide a sample to everyone. Tell them what you did, that one sample is from the hotel chef and the other from ChatGPT. Ask them to think about texture, flavour etc, and discuss at the tables (this will likely happen anyway).
- Eventually you can ask which they prefer.
- Ask which they think which was the AI generated recipe.
- If there's time, ask what led them to their conclusions.
- Remind them of the goals of AI (replicate human stuff), writing rules (like a person would) and automating rule-writing. Tell them about the Turing test. Ask about other kinds of Turing test, maybe in their domain.
- If there's time, go to Q&A.

We thought about setting this up as a sort of game-show, but went for feeding everyone in the end. 

Our results: 

- The chocolate cake tasted good but was rather dry. The AI added cardamom and cinnamon (as a Norwegian twist), but misjudged the quantities. No-one was fooled, and everyone preferred the hotel's recipe.
- The smoothie was quite different from the hotel's smoothie, again containing cinnamon as well as coconut milk, vanilla and blueberries. About 50% of people preferred it to the hotel's simpler recipe, and about 65% of people identified it correctly. One person said, "It was too expensive-tasting to be made by a commercial caterer".
