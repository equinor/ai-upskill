# AI or cake?

This is an image-based Turing text for less technical audiences.

Provide a set of at least 10 and up to 20 images of cakes. Some should be real and some AI-generated. The goal is to guess correctly about each image. Give a small prize for the best players.

Could be combined with [Say What You See](./third-party-games.md) or [AI chef](./ai-chef.md). 

## Example image list

AI-generated images were all generated by Matt Hall on 10 December 2024; they show the model and prompt. Real images were uploaded to Flickr before 2021 and carry Creative Commons licenses; they were downloaded by Matt Hall in 2024 and used as-is.

Shallow depth of field, cell-phone style."
