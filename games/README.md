# Games

We have tried playing a few games in workshops:

- [The Hallucination Game](./hallucinaton-game.md)
- [What Prompt](./what-prompt.md)
- [Playing Games](game-cards.md) (needs some preparation)
- [The Timeline Game](./timeline-game.md) (needs some preparation)
- [The AI Chef](ai-chef.md) (needs a lot of preparation)

We also sometimes use [some third-party games](./third-party-games.md), most of which need no preparation.
