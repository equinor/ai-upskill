# Playing games

- Purpose: intermediate-level practice with text-to-text generation; intermediate level prompt engineering. Provides insight into how chat 'threads' work, and into chat limitations.
- Time required: one or two blocks of 20-25 minutes.
- Group size: up to about 40 people working in pairs.

The goal of this game is to get a chat AI to play a game with you. [The game cards](./game-cards.md) provide short desciptions of 20 word games, varying somewhat in difficulty. Examples include Hangman and Twenty Questions. Several of the games can only be played in one 'direction'. For example, the AI cannot choose a word and store it, so it cannot be the word-setter in Hangman &mdash; it can only play the guesser. It may take time for people to understand this, perhaps discovering first that the model appears to cheat or change its word mid-game.

Teams should aim to construct a prompt that implements the game, complete with instructions. The goal is to be able to give another team a prompt, and have them play the game. Each card has 'stretch goals' which a team can try to implement if they have time and interest. After one round of 20-25 minutes, you can ask some teams to share  their games with the others. For a second round, you could challenge teams to play each others' games, attempt their stretch goals, or try a new game.

The cards are [available as a PDF](game-cards.pdf) and are inexpensive to reproduce. We used 200 gsm card stock with milled edges.
