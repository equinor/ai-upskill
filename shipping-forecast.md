# Shipping Forecast

A machine learning challenge aimed at data scientists, developers, and other technical people. It can be run as a slow-motion data science contest, or a short hackathon, or a combination of these.

## Task


## Dataset


## Evaluation app

A small Python FastAPI application facilitates the scoring of entries and provides a simple leaderboard. Teams interact with the API either via the Swagger docs, or in code using Python `requests` or similar. There is no Python API for taling to the web app, but this might be a cool idea.

It currently lives in [a private repo](https://github.com/scienxlab/adjudicator).
